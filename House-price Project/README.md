# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

## Introduction
This repository contains an end-to-end analysis and solution to the house prices project using the dataset : 

## House Price Project Problem Statement
Client: King County Department of Assessments, Washington State, USA.
Problem: The King County Assessor (https://kingcounty.gov/depts/assessor.aspx) is responsible for calculating property taxes for the Seattle area. According to the department’s website, residential property is assessed each year at its full market value, which is defined as “the amount a buyer, willing but not obligated to buy, would pay to a seller willing but not obligated to sell.” Property valuation is a politically contentious issue, and the assessor is looking to make use of all available to data to produce the most accurate market valuation of constituents’ properties.
Requirement: Using the house_sales.csv dataset, your team must create the most accurate multiple linear regression model they can to predict house prices (the AdjSalePrice variable). Accuracy will be measured according to both in-sample statistics (Multiple R-squared, F score, etc.) and out-of- sample statistics (i.e. RMSE of the prediction model on a holdout sample). At the end of the project, your team will be required to explain and justify its final model selection in a five minute presentation, which should also include a short handout (no more than two sides of A4).
 

The key practice skills in this competition are:
- Creative feature engineering
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
